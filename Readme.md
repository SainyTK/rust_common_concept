# Rust Common Concept
I learned the very basic concept about Rust programming. In this chapter, most of the things are similar to getting started on other languages. I have learned about:
1. Variables and declaration
2. Data types
3. Math operations
4. Conditional flow
5. Loop
6. Functions
7. Tuples and Arrays

## Running the code
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `cargo build` to install dependencies and compile the code.
3. Run `cargo run` to run the code.
